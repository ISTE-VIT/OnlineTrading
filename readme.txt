So this is basically Login/Register page for user based on NodeJS.

All the dependenciess have been mentioned and do not forget to install them before running it on your computer. 

Also databse is created in local computer only so u need to download mongodb compass and robo3t(to view your data) 
to use local computer as databse or online cloud can be used(like mongodb atlas). 

And Mongodb server can be connected by pasting following two links in two different comand prompt(use default file path).

1) "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.2\bin\mongo.exe"
2) "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.2\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath="c:\data\db"

And then open 3rd command prompt to run app.js file by node app.js
